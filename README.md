### pyIpScanAndWebCrawl 
Python scripts to scan random IP addresses for open and running web servers, then get and save some on them.

### Ideas
 - Replace storage in files with a database of some kind
 - Find good or common style and naming conventions and refactor accordingly
 - Implement collection of HTTP headers 
 - Implement taking screenshots of the open web servers
 - Implement a website to interface to the collected data (filters, sorting, previews, ...)
 - Implement running the different tasks (scanning, collecting data, making screenshots) as a service, the services then start- and stoppable over the web interface
